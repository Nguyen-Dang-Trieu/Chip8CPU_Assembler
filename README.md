# Project: Chip8CPU Emulator  + Assembler
# Introduce 
This project is designed to help me learn C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through implementing a Chip8 emulator and assembler. This project includes the following main components:
- `Chip8CPU`: A C++ class that emulates the Chip8 CPU. It includes the implementation of register, stack, memory, timer, keyboard input handling, .... and orther core functionalities of the Chip8 system.
- `Assembler`: A simple assembler that complies Chip8 assembly code into binary file that can be loaded into the Chip8 CPU.
